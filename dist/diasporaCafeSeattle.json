    "merchant_description": "\"Diaspora Seattle is a Yaupon Espresso roaster and supplier with diverse and growing ownership. Yaupon is the only caffeinated plant native to North America, known to some First Peoples as Turtle Island. It is considered a superfood high in many adaptogenic compounds including caffeine. It is also very low acid compared to coffee. When roasting, brewing and serving yaupon, we aim to honor and follow the traditions of those who cultivated the plants before us including the Cherokee, Choctaw, and Muscogee people. We use only Regenerative Organic Certified® yaupon leaves from small farms in Georgia, Florida and Texas. The flavor includes familiar notes of both tea and coffee. Turtle Island Energy!\"",
